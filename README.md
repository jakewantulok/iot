## Grove Starter Kit for Particle Mesh üå±

### Particle Jukebox üéπ

`particlejukebox.ino` is a fully functioning demo for **[The Grove Starter Kit for Particle Mesh](https://store.particle.io/products/grove-starter-kit)**. It also demonstrates how to use [`Particle.function()`](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/firmware/photon/#cloud-functions). Just *flash ‚ö°Ô∏è* this sketch to your Particle Argon and see how it works!

For a better understanding of how this works, I have three versions of Particle Jukebox to select from:

- **"Button Only"** version using only the button (See `particlejukebox_btnonly.ino`)
- **"Cloud Only"** version using only `Particle.function()` (See `particlejukebox_cldonly.ino`)
- **"Full"** version using *both* the button as well as `Particle.function()` (See `particlejukebox.ino`)

#### Requirements:

- One claimed Particle Argon
- Grove Starter Kit for Particle Mesh
    - Grove shield for Particle Argon
    - Button ~ plugged into grove shield `D2`
    - Buzzer ~ plugged into grove shield `D4`
- USB Cable & Internet! (duh)

#### Tunes üé∂ 

After you have uploaded `particlejukebox.ino` to your Particle Argon, you will find "PlayTune" located in the **Functions** section in your [console](https://login.particle.io/login?redirect=https://console.particle.io/). (It's also handy to control your Particle Argon using the [app!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/particle-iot/id991459054)) Enter any of the following to listen:

- Pok√©mon
- Kim Possible
- Power Rangers
- Sesame Street
- Smooth Criminal
- Star Wars
- Indiana Jones
- Mario Bros
- Legend of Zelda
- Door Knock

Also, this is the play order each time the button is pressed. When you finally hear the "Door Knock" melody, it will reset to the first tune. If you ever mistype when calling the Particle Function, the "Door Knock" melody will also play for you. 

#### Composition

The `jukebox()` function requires the melody array `melody[]`, the melody sequence `melodySeq[]` and the size/length of the arrays. The key to getting your tune working correctly is to make sure `melody[]` & `melodySeq[]` are equal in size and specifying this size when calling `jukebox()`.

```C++
int jukebox(int melody [], int melodySeq [], int size) {
    
    for (int note = 0; note < size; note++) {
      int duration = 1000/melodySeq[note];
      tone(BZZ, melody[note], duration);
      delay(duration * 1.30);
    }
    tune++; // next tune
}
```
Example:
```C++
jukebox(pokemon, pokemonSeq, 3);
```

`melody` requires an arrangement of notes. For regular notes you will need to write in lowercase (`a`) and sharp notes in uppercase (`A`). 

```C++
int pokemon[] = {d,f,g};
```

However, in some cases you might need one note at a higher or lower octave. Just write whatever note with `*2` or `/2`

```C++
int indianaJones[] = {d,D,f,A*2,d,f,D}; // (with a# one octave above)
```

`melodySeq` is used to create the rhythm to your melody. It can be a little tricky, but the numbers given to the array should make sense for someone familiar to playing an instrument. There are whole `1`, quarter `4`, eighth `8` etc. You will see a few variances in this sketch such as `6`, `12`, and `3`. This was intended to slow down the melody without altering the loop. Smooth Criminal is an example of this. (You can also play around with different time signatures, if you know what you're doing!) 

You can also add pauses to your tune by adding `0`.

```C++
int mario[] =    {e,e,e,d,e,g,0,g/2};
int marioSeq[] = {8,8,4,8,4,4,4,  4};
```

#### Additional Notes:

This was written with the button connected. Once the button has been removed, you will immediately hear every tune play in a continuous loop. I highly recommend commenting out the following if you wish to control your Particle Argon using only the Particle Cloud Function:
- `#define BTN D2` at the top
- `pinMode(BTN, INPUT);` in your `void setup()`
- Everything inside `void loop()`
